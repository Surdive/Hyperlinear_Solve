# Hyperlinear_Solve
A Python implementation for solving hyperlinear equations in Krasner hyperfields, specifically designed for research in algebraic hyperstructures.

# Overview

This library provides tools to solve hyperlinear inclusions of the form B ⊆ A⊙X where:
- A is a matrix with elements from a Krasner hyperfield
- B is a vector with elements from the same hyperfield
- X is the unknown solution vector
- ⊙ represents scalar multiplication
- ⊕ represents hyperaddition (returning sets of elements)

# Core Functions

# expand_matrix(matrix)
Expands a matrix containing sets into all possible concrete matrices.

Parameters:
- matrix: List of lists where each element is a set

Returns:
- List of matrices where each element is chosen from the corresponding set in the original matrix

Example:
M = [
    [{1, 2}, {0, 2}],
    [{0, 1}, {1, 2}]
]
expanded = expand_matrix(M)
 Returns all possible 2x2 matrices with elements chosen from the sets

# hyper_linear_solve(K, add_table, mul_table, A, B)
Solves hyperlinear inclusions in Krasner hyperfields using exhaustive search.

Parameters:
- K: List of hyperfield elements
- add_table: Dictionary {(x,y): set} representing hyperaddition ⊕
- mul_table: Dictionary {(x,y): element} representing multiplication ⊙
- A: Coefficient matrix (list of lists)
- B: Target vector (list)

Returns:
- List of solution vectors X satisfying B ⊆ A⊙X

# Mathematical Background

# Krasner Hyperfields
A Krasner hyperfield is an algebraic structure where:
- Addition is a hyperoperation (returns sets)
- Multiplication is a classical operation (returns single elements)
- Satisfies specific axioms for hyperfield structures

# Hyperlinear Systems
Unlike classical linear systems Ax = b, hyperlinear systems involve:
- Inclusion relations instead of equality
- Hyperoperations that produce sets of results
- Multiple valid solutions due to the nature of hyperaddition

 Usage Example

import itertools
 Define Krasner hyperfield K = {0, 1, 2}
K = [0, 1, 2]

 Hyperaddition table
add_table = {
    (0, 0): {0}, (0, 1): {1}, (0, 2): {2},
    (1, 0): {1}, (1, 1): {1}, (1, 2): {0, 1, 2},
    (2, 0): {2}, (2, 1): {0, 1, 2}, (2, 2): {2}
}

 Multiplication table
mul_table = {
    (0, 0): 0, (0, 1): 0, (0, 2): 0,
    (1, 0): 0, (1, 1): 1, (1, 2): 2,
    (2, 0): 0, (2, 1): 2, (2, 2): 1
}

 Define matrix with sets
M = [
    [{1, 2}, {0, 2}, {0, 1}],
    [{0, 1}, {1, 2}, {0, 2}],
    [{0, 1, 2}, {1, 2}, {1, 2}]
]

 Target vector
B = [1, 2, 0]

 Solve for all possible matrices
expanded_matrices = expand_matrix(M)
solutions = []
for matrix in expanded_matrices:
    sols = hyper_linear_solve(K, add_table, mul_table, matrix, B)
    solutions.append(sols)

print(f"Total solution sets")

# Computational Complexity

Warning: This implementation uses brute force search and has exponential complexity:
- expand_matrix: O(∏|sets|) where |sets| is the size of each set
- hyper_linear_solve: O(|K|^n) where n is the number of variables

Recommended for:
- Small hyperfields (|K| ≤ 10)
- Research and theoretical exploration
- Educational purposes

Not recommended for:
- Large-scale computations
- Production systems requiring efficiency

# Applications

- Algebraic Hyperstructure Research: Study of hyperideals, hyperrings, and hyperfields
- Mathematical Logic: Investigation of non-classical algebraic structures
- Theoretical Computer Science: Exploration of generalized computational models

# Dependencies

- Python 3.6+
- itertools (standard library)

# Mathematical References

This implementation is based on the theory of:
- Krasner hyperfields and hyperstructures
- Algebraic hyperstructure theory
- Generalized linear algebra in hyperfields

# Limitations

1. Scalability: Exponential complexity limits practical use to small systems
2. Memory usage: Stores all possible combinations in memory
3. Numerical precision: Designed for discrete hyperfields only

# Future Improvements

- Implement more efficient algorithms for specific hyperfield classes
- Add support for infinite hyperfields
- Optimize memory usage for large solution sets
- Include additional hyperstructure types (hyperrings, hyperlattices)
